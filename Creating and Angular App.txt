Creating an Angular App
* navigate to the folder directory you want your new app *
ng new myFirstAngularApp

Generating Components, Directives, Services and Pipes
The following commands allow us to create different parts of an Angular application.

* navigate into your new angular application folder *
cd myFirstAngularApp
ng generate component my-component - Creates a component
ng generate service my-service - Creates a service
ng generate class my-class - Creates a class

Launching the App
As part of your newly created Angular app, we are given a light weight server which launches our application. To do so we run 
ng serve 
from inside of the project folder directory (through the terminal). The terminal will start the process and inform us that Angular is running at http://localhost:4200
